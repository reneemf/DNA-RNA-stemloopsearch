# DNA-RNA-stemloopsearch
Finds longest stem-loop (hairpin) in NCBI GenBank sequence

Requests a user's input, of a valid NCBI GenBank DNA or RNA accession number and returns the longest stem-loop sequence.

Stem-loops occur when two regions of the same strand, usually complementary in nucleotide sequence when read in opposite directions, base-pair to form a double helix that ends in an unpaired loop. This structure is a key building block of many RNA secondary structures. As an important secondary structure of RNA, it can direct RNA folding, protect structural stability for messenger RNA (mRNA), provide recognition sites for RNA binding proteins, and serve as a substrate for enzymatic reactions.
